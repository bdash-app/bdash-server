Bdash Server is powered by [Blitz.js](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

## Setup

Make your own `.env.local` from `.env.local.example` for development.

```sh
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

And write your own `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` for OAuth.

You can generate OAuth web client ID by following the steps described in: https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/9222992.

After that,
- Set `http://localhost:3000` as _Authorized JavaScript origins_
- Set `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback` as _Authorized redirect URIs_

## Run

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

Docker is required. üê≥

Run db:migrate to setup database.

$ yarn db:migrate
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
